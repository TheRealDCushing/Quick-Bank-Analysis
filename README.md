# PyBank with Jupyter Notebook & Pandas:

Objective: To describe key characteristics of the dataset, and print a small report of the findings within a specific, predetermined format. Determine when the greatest increase in profits occurred, and the magnitude of that increase. Determine when the greatest decrease in profits occurred, and the magnitude of that decrease. Determine the average change in profits, and the total number of months.

A note about the dataset: This dataset contains only two columns: One with the date, and one with the magnitude of profit change.

Enjoyable Success: In Input Cell 6, the .diff() function simplified analysis significantly.

Lesson(s) learned: Use of the variable name "Cache" at the end of both Jupyter Notebooks led to an error in printing.
